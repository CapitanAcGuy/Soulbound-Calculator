# __Soulbound Calculator__ ![Soulbound Calculator Icon](https://github.com/CapitanAcGuy/Soulbound-Calculator/blob/main/Soulbound%20Calculator%20Icon.ico =250x250 )

An unofficial app for the TTRPG [Soulbound](https://cubicle7games.com/our-games/age-of-sigmar-soulbound/) created by Cubicle 7. 

In its current state, __Soulbound Calculator__ focuses solely on Combat as I've found that to be the biggest issue new/newer PCs struggle with. This app will allow users to accessibly run their own Combat sims to see how their stat allocations add up.

The app is designed to be open-source to allow for users to adapt __Soulbound Calculator__ to their specific needs. Want to roll 100 Attack Dice? How about even *more* damage???! I've added in lots of comments that allow for all levels of programmers to start messing with the app.

**Soulbound Calculator** is not official and is meant to supplement Cubicle 7 releases. Please support the official releases and the amazing people who make it! They consistently release free add-ons for the community and deserve the love!

## About Me 👋 

Hey, I'm Eric!

I've been a fan of the TTRPG genre for a bit now, starting as a PC before going into DM territory. While Soulbound has been my passion, I used to be into the [Warhammer Age of Sigmar](https://ageofsigmar.com/) TTG proper (Flesh Eater Courts, Hedonites of Slaanesh, Ironjawz, Stormcast Eternals) before 2020.

## Features ✨

The app currently accomodates for the following:
- Number of Attack Dice (1-20)
- Attack Value
- Defense Value
- Focus (0-6)
- Weapon Damage (0-9)
- Armor (0-9)

I've added in a bunch of smaller stuff as well that I think would interest users like roll results with and without Focus, and an average damage referred to as "Final Expected Damage" (based off 1000 sims).

## To Do 🛠️

Short Term Goals (+2 xp)
- Convert app to Python

Long Term Goals (+10 xp)
- Restucture app from CLI > GUI
- Add in accomodations for DN tests

## Installation 💻

__Soulbound Calculator__ is supported on the following systems:
- Windows 10
